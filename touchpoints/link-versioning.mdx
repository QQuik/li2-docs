title: Link Versioning
description: Understanding how Li2.ai tracks link changes and manages version history for better campaign management and analytics.
---

# Link Versioning

Link versioning automatically tracks changes to your touchpoint short links, maintaining a complete history while ensuring all previous versions continue to work. This powerful feature helps you optimize campaigns while preserving analytics data and user access.

## What Is Link Versioning?

When you edit a touchpoint's short link, Li2.ai creates a **new version** while keeping the old version fully functional. This means:

- **All previous links continue to work** - No broken links for your audience
- **Complete analytics history** - Performance data preserved across all versions
- **Easy version tracking** - See which version is currently active
- **Change management** - Up to 5 modifications allowed per touchpoint

<Note>
**Example**: If you change `li2.ai/summer-sale` to `li2.ai/summer-launch`, both links will work and direct users to your destination, but analytics will show which version they used.
</Note>

## How Versioning Works

### The Version System

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial creation">
    When you create a touchpoint, you get **Version 1** of your short link.
    
    This version is marked as "Latest" and is your active link for sharing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Making changes">
    When you edit the short link (click the edit icon next to your link):
    - The current version remains active and accessible
    - A new version is created with your changes
    - The new version becomes "Latest"
    - Your change counter decreases by 1
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Version history">
    In your touchpoint details, you can see:
    - All previous versions of the link
    - Which version is currently "Latest" 
    - Complete analytics for each version
    - Change dates and history
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What You See

In the **Edit Short Link** dialog, you'll see:
- **Current link**: Your active short link
- **Version history**: List of all previous versions
- **"Latest" indicator**: Shows which version is current
- **Changes remaining**: How many more changes you can make

## The 5-Change Limit

### Understanding the Constraint

<Warning>
**Important**: You can only modify a touchpoint's short link **5 times total**. Plan your changes carefully!
</Warning>

**Why this limit exists**:
- Prevents excessive link changes that could confuse analytics
- Encourages thoughtful planning and strategic link management
- Maintains system performance and reliability
- Supports professional campaign management practices

### Managing Your Changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plan before you change">
    **Before making any modifications**:
    - Consider the long-term use of the touchpoint
    - Think about campaign lifecycle and evolution
    - Plan multiple changes in advance if needed
    - Test concepts before implementing permanently
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use changes strategically">
    **Best times to modify links**:
    - Major campaign updates or rebrands
    - Seasonal campaign transitions
    - A/B testing different messaging approaches
    - Fixing confusing or non-descriptive links
    - Aligning with updated marketing materials
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When you're running low">
    **If you have few changes left**:
    - Consider creating a new touchpoint instead
    - Plan remaining changes very carefully
    - Document reasons for each change
    - Coordinate with team before making changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Version History

### Reading Version Information

In your touchpoint's version history, you'll see:

**Current Version (Latest)**:
- **Link**: `li2.ai/your-current-link`  
- **Status**: "Latest" indicator
- **Created**: Date and time of this version

**Previous Versions**:
- **Link**: `li2.ai/previous-link`
- **Created**: When this version was active
- **Analytics**: Performance data for this specific version

### Analytics Across Versions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Individual version tracking">
    Each version maintains its own analytics:
    - Clicks and scans specific to that version
    - Performance data from when it was active
    - Geographic and timing information
    - Channel-specific metrics (LINK vs QR)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combined analytics">
    Your touchpoint's main analytics show:
    - **Total performance** across all versions
    - **Combined metrics** for overall campaign success
    - **Timeline view** showing performance evolution
    - **Version comparison** data when available
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Strategic Planning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plan your link evolution">
    **Consider the campaign lifecycle**:
    - Initial launch link (e.g., `campaign-preview`)
    - Main campaign link (e.g., `campaign-launch`) 
    - Optimization versions (e.g., `campaign-special`)
    - Closing phase link (e.g., `campaign-final`)
    
    This approach uses your 5 changes strategically across the entire campaign.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before committing">
    **Before using a change**:
    - Discuss link options with your team
    - Consider how the link sounds when spoken aloud
    - Check that the link makes sense for all marketing materials
    - Ensure the link will remain relevant for the campaign duration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document your changes">
    **Keep track of modifications**:
    - Note why you made each change
    - Record performance before and after changes
    - Share change rationale with team members
    - Plan future changes based on results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Seasonal campaign updates">
    **Example**: Holiday promotion touchpoint
    - Version 1: `holiday-preview` (early announcement)
    - Version 2: `holiday-sale` (main promotion)
    - Version 3: `holiday-final` (last chance messaging)
    
    Each version aligns with the campaign phase while maintaining analytics continuity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="A/B testing messaging">
    **Example**: Product launch touchpoint
    - Version 1: `new-product` (simple, direct)

    - Version 3: `innovation-2025` (benefit-focused)
    
    Compare performance to see which messaging resonates best.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Improving memorability">
    **Example**: Demo request touchpoint
    - Version 1: `li2.ai/6LAG5` (auto-generated)
    - Version 2: `request-demo` (clear and memorable)
    
    Simple improvement that makes the link much more user-friendly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Version Limits

### What to Do When You Run Out of Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess your needs">
    - How many more changes do you anticipate?
    - Is this touchpoint critical to ongoing campaigns?
    - Would a new touchpoint serve your needs better?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider alternatives">
    **Option 1: Create a new touchpoint**
    - Start fresh with 5 new changes available
    - Maintain the old touchpoint for existing materials
    - Use for evolved or significantly different campaigns
    
    **Option 2: Keep the current version**
    - If the current link works well, no changes needed
    - Focus optimization efforts on destination content instead
    - Reserve remaining changes for critical future needs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Plan for the future">
    - Create new touchpoints earlier in the planning process
    - Consider version limits when planning campaign evolution
    - Use auto-generated links when custom links aren't essential
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Version Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Old links not working">
    **This shouldn't happen** - all versions should remain functional.
    
    **If you experience this**:
    - Check the exact link URL for typos
    - Try the link in a different browser or device
    - Contact support if the issue persists
    - Verify the touchpoint is still active
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confused about which version is active">
    **Look for the "Latest" indicator** in your version history.
    
    **The active version is**:
    - Marked as "Latest" in the edit dialog
    - The one shown in your touchpoint details
    - The most recently created version
    - The one you should share in new materials
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't make changes">
    **Check your remaining changes counter.**
    
    **If you've used all 5 changes**:
    - Consider if the change is truly necessary
    - Explore creating a new touchpoint instead
    - Contact support if you need assistance with strategy
  </Accordion>
