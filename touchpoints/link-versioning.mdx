## Working with Version Limits

### What to Do When You Run Out of Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess your needs">
    - How many more changes do you anticipate?
    - Is this touchpoint critical to ongoing campaigns?
    - Would a new touchpoint serve your needs better?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider alternatives">
    **Option 1: Create a new touchpoint**

    - Start fresh with 5 new changes available
    - Maintain the old touchpoint for existing materials
    - Use for evolved or significantly different campaigns

    **Option 2: Keep the current version**

    - If the current link works well, no changes needed
    - Focus optimization efforts on destination content instead
    - Reserve remaining changes for critical future needs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan for the future">
    - Create new touchpoints earlier in the planning process
    - Consider version limits when planning campaign evolution
