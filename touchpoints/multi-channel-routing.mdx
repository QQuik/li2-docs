# Multi-Channel Routing

Multi-channel routing allows you to send users to different destination URLs depending on how they access your touchpoint. This powerful feature enables sophisticated A/B testing, audience segmentation, and channel-specific optimization strategies.

## What Is Multi-Channel Routing?

Instead of sending all users to the same destination, multi-channel routing lets you customize the user experience based on their interaction method:

- **LINK Channel** (Digital) → One destination URL
- **QR Channel** (Physical) → Different destination URL
- **WiFi Channel** (Coming Soon) → Unique destination URL
- **NFC Channel** (Coming Soon) → Specialized destination URL

<Note>
  **Example**: Your LINK channel could direct users to a desktop-optimized landing page, while your QR channel sends mobile users to a mobile-first experience with location-specific offers.
</Note>
