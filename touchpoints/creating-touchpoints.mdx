## Basic Touchpoint Configuration

### Essential Information Setup

<Steps>

    Navigate to your Proxify dashboard and click **"Create Touchpoint"** or go to **Touchpoints** → **"\+ Create Touchpoint"**.

    ![Create Touchpoint Pn](/images/create-touchpoint.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure basic information">
    **Touchpoint Name**

    - **Purpose**: Internal identification and campaign management
    - **Best Practices**: Descriptive, campaign-specific, team-friendly
    - **Examples**:
      - `Q3-Product-Launch-Landing-Page`
      - `Email-Newsletter-Signup-Form`
      - `Trade-Show-Demo-Request`
      - `Social-Media-Bio-Link-Updates`

    **Destination URL**

    - **Purpose**: Primary redirect target for all channels (unless using multi-channel routing)
    - **Requirements**: Complete URL with `https://` protocol

      ![Destination Url Pn](/images/destination-url.png)
    - **Considerations**:
      - Mobile responsiveness and load speed
      - Analytics tracking and conversion setup
      - Content relevance to campaign goals
      - Geographic accessibility and compliance

    **Tag Assignment**

    - **Purpose**: Campaign organization and filtering
    - **Strategy**: Develop consistent tagging taxonomy
    - **Examples**:
      - Campaign: `summer-2025`, `product-launch`, `webinar-series`
      - Channel: `social-media`, `email`, `print`, `events`
      - Team: `sales`, `marketing`, `customer-success`
      - Content: `landing-pages`, `demos`, `resources`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Short Link Customization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand link generation">
    **Automatic Generation**: Proxify creates unique short links using the format `li2.ai/[unique-string]`

    **Default Benefits**:

    - Guaranteed uniqueness and availability
    - Immediate activation and functionality
    - No conflicts or duplication issues
    - Professional appearance and trustworthiness
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom back-half configuration">
    **When to Customize**:

    - Offline marketing materials (memorable URLs)
    - Verbal communication and presentations
    - Brand consistency across campaigns
    - Long-term or permanent touchpoints

    ![Custom Back Half Pn](/images/custom-back-half.png)

    **Customization Best Practices**:

    ```
    Good Examples:
    li2.ai/summer-sale     (campaign-specific)
    li2.ai/demo-request    (action-focused)  
    li2.ai/contact-sales   (purpose-clear)
    li2.ai/q3-webinar      (time-specific)
    
    Avoid:
    li2.ai/click-here-now-for-amazing-deals  (too long)
    li2.ai/a1b2c3          (not memorable)
    li2.ai/temp            (not descriptive)
    ```

    **Technical Considerations**:

    - Maximum 5 changes allowed per touchpoint
    - Changes create new versions with complete tracking
    - Previous versions remain accessible and tracked
    - URL availability checked automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link versioning management">
    **Version Tracking**:

    - Complete history of all link changes
    - Performance comparison across versions
    - Rollback capability to previous versions
    - Analytics continuity across changes

    **Change Strategy**:

    - Plan changes carefully due to 5-change limit
    - Consider campaign lifecycle and longevity
    - Document reasons for changes in campaign notes
    - Test new versions before broad distribution
  </Step>
</Steps>
