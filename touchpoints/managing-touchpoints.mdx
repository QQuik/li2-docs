## Organizing with Tags

### Creating and Using Tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create tags">
    Go to **Tags** in the main menu and click **"\+ Create Tag"**.

    **Useful tag examples**:

    - Campaign names: `summer-2025`, `product-launch`
    - Channels: `social-media`, `email`, `print`
    - Content types: `landing-pages`, `demos`, `resources`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply tags to touchpoints">
    When creating or editing touchpoints, add relevant tags in the **Tag** field.

    You can add multiple tags to organize touchpoints in different ways.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by tags">
    Use the filter options in the touchpoints list to show only touchpoints with specific tags.

    This makes it easy to review campaign performance or find related touchpoints.
  </Step>
</Steps>
