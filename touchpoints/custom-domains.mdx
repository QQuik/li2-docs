# Custom Domains

Custom domains allow you to use your own branded domain for short links instead of the default `li2.ai` domain. This creates professional, trustworthy links that reinforce your brand identity and improve click-through rates.

## Why Use Custom Domains?

  <Card title="Professional Branding" icon="badge-check" color="#10B981">
    Links like `yourbrand.com/summer-sale` look more professional than generic short links.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Increased Trust" icon="shield-check" color="#10B981">
    Users are more likely to click links from domains they recognize and trust.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brand Consistency" icon="palette" color="#10B981">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Better Analytics" icon="chart-line" color="#10B981">

**Example**: Instead of `li2.ai/abc123`, you could have `yourbrand.com/product-launch` or `links.yourcompany.com/newsletter`.

## Setting Up Custom Domains

### Step 1: Add Your Domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to domain settings">
    1. Go to **Settings** in the main menu
    2. Click **Organization Settings** in the left sidebar
    3. Select **Customize Domain**
    4. Click **"+ Add Domain"**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your domain">
    In the "Add domain" dialog:
    1. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `links.yourcompany.com`)
    2. Click **"Next"** to proceed to verification
    
    <Note>
    **Domain Tips**: Use a subdomain like `links.yourcompany.com` or `go.yourcompany.com` rather than your main domain. This keeps your main website separate from your short links.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Verify Domain Ownership

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access DNS settings">
    You'll need to access your domain's DNS settings through your domain registrar or hosting provider (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add CNAME record">
    **CNAME Record Setup**:
    - **Name**: `@` (or leave blank for root domain)
    - **Target**: `li2.ai`
    - **TTL**: Default (usually 3600 or "Automatic")
    
    This record tells browsers where to find your short links.
    
    <Tip>
    If you're using a subdomain like `links.yourcompany.com`, the Name field should be `links` instead of `@`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add TXT record for verification">
    **TXT Record Setup**:
    - **Name**: `_proxify-shortlink-verification`
    - **Content**: The verification code shown in Proxify (looks like `b3c0fb26-a4a8-4db5-bfac-97cf5ee6e1cc`)
    - **TTL**: Default
    
    This record proves you own the domain.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for DNS propagation">
    <Warning>
    **DNS changes can take up to 48 hours** to propagate worldwide. Most changes happen within a few hours, but be patient if verification doesn't work immediately.
    </Warning>
    
    You can check if your DNS changes have propagated using online DNS checker tools.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify in Proxify">
    1. After setting up both DNS records, return to Proxify
    2. Click **"Verify"** in the domain verification dialog
    3. If successful, your domain will show as "Verified" in your domain list
    4. If verification fails, double-check your DNS records and try again
    
    <Note>
    **Monitor Verification Status**: You can check your domain's verification status anytime in Settings → Organization Settings → Customize Domain. Domains will show status as "Verifying", "Verified", or "Failed".
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Domain Verification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check verification status">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Organization Settings** → **Customize Domain** to see all your domains with their current verification status:
    
    - **Verifying**: Domain verification is in progress
    - **Verified**: Domain is ready to use in touchpoints
    - **Failed**: Verification failed, DNS records need attention
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Re-verify domains when needed">
    If a domain verification fails or you need to verify again:
    
    1. Find your domain in the custom domains list
    2. Click the **three dots (⋯)** menu next to the domain
    3. Select **"Verify"** from the action menu
    4. The system will re-check your DNS records
    
    <Tip>
    **When to re-verify**: After updating DNS records, if verification initially failed, or if a previously verified domain stops working.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete unused domains">
    You can also remove domains you no longer need:
    
    1. Click the **three dots (⋯)** menu next to the domain
    2. Select **"Delete"** from the action menu
    3. Confirm deletion
    
    <Warning>
    **Before deleting**: Make sure no active touchpoints are using this domain, as this will break those links.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Custom Domains

### Selecting Domains for Touchpoints

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain selection during creation">
    When creating a new touchpoint:
    1. In the **Short Link** section, you'll see a **Domain** dropdown
    2. The default selection is `li2.ai`
    3. Click the dropdown to see your verified custom domains
    4. Select your preferred domain for this touchpoint
    5. Complete the rest of your touchpoint setup normally
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search for domains">
    If you have multiple custom domains:
    - Use the search box in the domain dropdown
    - Type part of your domain name to filter options
    - Select the appropriate domain for your campaign
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important Domain Limitations

<Warning>
**Cannot Change Domains After Creation**: Once you create a touchpoint with a specific domain, you cannot change it to a different domain. You can only edit the back-half of the link (e.g., changing `summer-sale` to `summer-launch`).

If you need a different domain, you must create a new touchpoint.
</Warning>

**Planning Considerations**:
- Choose your domain carefully before creating touchpoints
- Consider which domain best fits each campaign's purpose
- Plan domain usage strategy across different marketing channels

## Troubleshooting Custom Domains

### Common DNS Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verification fails">
    **Check these common issues**:
    
    **CNAME Record Problems**:
    - Ensure the target is exactly `li2.ai` (no trailing dots or extra characters)
    - For subdomains, use the subdomain name (e.g., `links`) not `@`
    - Some DNS providers require different formats - check their documentation
    
    **TXT Record Problems**:
    - Verify the name is exactly `_proxify-shortlink-verification`
    - Copy the verification code exactly as shown (no extra spaces)
    - Some providers require quotes around the TXT record value
    
    **DNS Propagation**:
    - Wait longer - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours
    - Try verification again after a few hours
    - Use DNS checker tools to verify your records are visible globally
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Domain not appearing in dropdown">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Domain verification hasn't completed yet
    - DNS records weren't set up correctly
    - Browser cache needs to be refreshed
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify domain status in Settings → Organization Settings → Customize Domain
    - Check that domain shows as "Verified" in your domain list
    - Refresh your browser and try creating a touchpoint again
    - Contact support if domain is verified but not appearing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Links not working after setup">
    **Troubleshooting steps**:
    - Test the link in an incognito/private browser window
    - Check if the issue is global or regional (DNS propagation)
    - Verify the CNAME record is pointing to `li2.ai`
    - Ensure no other DNS records are conflicting
    - Contact your DNS provider if issues persist
