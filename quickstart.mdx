  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure basic settings">
    Fill in the touchpoint details:

    **Name**: Give your touchpoint a descriptive name (e.g., "Summer Campaign Landing Page")

    **Destination URL**: Enter the full URL where you want to send visitors (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/summer-sale`)

    **Tag (Optional)**: Add a tag like "summer-campaign" to organize your touchpoints

    ![Configure Basic Information Pn](/images/Configure-basic-information.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your short link (Optional)">
    In the **Short Link** section:

    - Keep the default auto-generated link, or
    - Click the edit icon to customize the back-half (e.g., `li2.ai/summer-sale`)

      ![Custom Back Half Pn](/images/custom-back-half.png)

    <Tip>
      Custom back-halves make your links more memorable and brand-friendly, especially for offline marketing materials.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure integration channels">
    In the **Integration Channel** section:

    - **LINK**: This is automatically enabled - your primary short link
    - **QR**: Toggle this ON to enable QR code generation

    **Expected result**: You should be redirected to your destination URL.

  <Step title="Download your QR code">
    Still in the **Details** tab, locate the **QR** section:

    - Your branded QR code is automatically generated
    - Click **"Download"** to save the QR code image
    - Use **"Customize"** to modify the design (optional)

## Step 4: Organize with Tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a tag to your touchpoint">
    From the touchpoint details **Details** tab, add a tag in the **Tag (Optional)** field if you haven't already.

    Examples: `summer-campaign`, `social-media`, `email-newsletter`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create additional tags">
    Navigate to the **Tags** section in the main menu and click **"\+ Create Tag"**.

    Create a few organizing tags like:

    - Campaign names: `summer-2025`, `product-launch`
    - Channels: `social-media`, `email`, `print-ads`
    - Content types: `blog-posts`, `product-pages`, `landing-pages`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter and organize">
    Return to your **Touchpoints** list and use the search and filter options to organize by tags.

    This becomes invaluable as you create more touchpoints for different campaigns.

    - Performance trends over time
    - Top-performing touchpoints
