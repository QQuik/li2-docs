# Meta Tags Setup

Configure custom meta tags to control exactly how your touchpoints appear when shared on social media platforms. Upload branded images, craft compelling titles, and write engaging descriptions for professional social media presence.

<Note>
**Premium Feature**: Custom meta tags are available for Premium tier users. Without premium access, touchpoints use default Proxify meta tags when shared.
</Note>

## Automatic Meta Tag Detection

<Note>
**Smart Auto-Fill**: When Premium users create touchpoints, Proxify automatically fetches the destination URL's existing meta title, meta description, and Open Graph image to pre-populate your meta tags. This saves time and provides a professional starting point for customization.
</Note>

**How Auto-Detection Works**:
- **Meta Title**: Automatically pulled from destination page's `<title>` tag
- **Meta Description**: Fetched from destination page's meta description
- **OG Image**: Retrieved from destination page's Open Graph image
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Uses best available content if primary meta tags aren't found

**Benefits**:
- **Time Saving**: No need to manually recreate existing page meta data
- **Professional Quality**: Starts with the destination page's optimized content
- **Easy Customization**: Use auto-filled content as-is or customize further
- **Consistent Messaging**: Maintains alignment between destination and social preview

## Accessing Meta Tags

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to touchpoint advanced settings">
    1. Go to **Touchpoints** and select your touchpoint
    2. Click on the **Advanced** tab
    3. Find the **Meta Tags** section
    4. Toggle **Meta Tags** to **ON** to enable customization
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start customizing">
    Once enabled, you'll see three customization options:
    - **Image**: Upload custom social media preview image (may be auto-filled)
    - **Title**: Set custom title for social sharing (may be auto-filled)
    - **Description**: Write engaging description text (may be auto-filled)
    
    Plus a **live preview** showing how your content will appear when shared.
    
    <Tip>
    **Auto-Filled Content**: If your destination URL has existing meta tags, these fields may already contain the fetched content from your destination page. You can use this content as-is or customize it further.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Auto-Filled Content

### Understanding Auto-Detection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic fetching during creation">
    When Premium users create a new touchpoint:
    1. Proxify analyzes the destination URL
    2. Extracts existing meta title, description, and Open Graph image
    3. Pre-populates meta tag fields with found content
    4. Provides immediate professional preview
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and customize">
    **Options with Auto-Filled Content**:
    - **Use As-Is**: Keep the automatically fetched content
    - **Customize**: Modify titles, descriptions, or images for your campaign
    - **Replace**: Upload new images or completely rewrite content
    - **Mix and Match**: Keep some auto-filled elements, customize others
  </Step>
</Steps>
