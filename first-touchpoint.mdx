# Create Your First Touchpoint

Creating your first touchpoint is an exciting milestone! In this comprehensive guide, you'll build a professional marketing asset that showcases Li2.ai's multi-channel distribution capabilities. By the end, you'll have a working short link, branded QR code, and analytics tracking.

## What You'll Create

In this tutorial, you'll build a complete marketing touchpoint that includes:

- ‚úÖ Professional branded short link
- ‚úÖ Custom QR code for offline marketing
- ‚úÖ Analytics tracking across all channels
- ‚úÖ Proper organization with tags
- ‚úÖ Testing verification to ensure everything works

**Example scenario**: We'll create a touchpoint for promoting a "Summer Product Launch" landing page that you can use across social media, email campaigns, and print materials.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- ‚úÖ Completed [account setup](/account-setup)
- ‚úÖ A destination URL ready (landing page, product page, signup form, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Access to your [Li2.ai dashboard](https://app.li2.ai)
- ‚úÖ About 15 minutes to complete the process

<Tip>
  **Don't have a destination URL yet?** You can use any website URL for practice - even your company homepage or LinkedIn profile. The important thing is learning the process!
</Tip>

---

## Step 1: Start Creating Your Touchpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to touchpoint creation">
    From your Li2.ai dashboard, click the **"Create Touchpoint"** button. You can find this:

    - On the main dashboard as a prominent button
    - In the Touchpoints section by clicking **"+ Create Touchpoint"**

      ![Create Touchpoint Pn](/images/create-touchpoint.png)

    This opens the touchpoint creation form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand the creation interface">
    The creation form has several sections:

    - **Basic Information**: Name, destination URL, and tag
    - **Short Link Configuration**: Custom domain and back-half options
    - **Integration Channels**: Multi-channel distribution settings

    We'll configure each section step by step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 2: Configure Basic Information

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your touchpoint">
    In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name that helps you identify this campaign later.

    **Good examples**:

    - "Summer Product Launch Landing Page"
    - "Newsletter Signup Form - Q3"
    - "Social Media Bio Link"
    - "Product Demo Request Page"

    **Why this matters**: Clear names help you find and manage touchpoints as your campaigns grow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your destination URL">
    In the **Destination URL** field, paste the complete URL where you want to send visitors.

    ![Destination Url Pn](/images/destination-url.png)

    **Examples**:

    ```
    https://yourcompany.com/summer-launch
    https://yoursite.com/newsletter-signup
    https://calendly.com/yourname/demo
    ```

    **Important**: Include the full URL with `https://` for proper tracking and redirection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a tag for organization">
    In the **Tag (Optional)** field, add a relevant tag to organize this touchpoint.

    **Suggested tag examples**:

    - `summer-2025` (for seasonal campaigns)
    - `product-launch` (for product-related content)
    - `social-media` (for social distribution)
    - `email-campaign` (for email marketing)

    <Note>
      Tags become powerful when you create multiple touchpoints. They help you filter, organize, and analyze campaign performance by category.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Customize Your Short Link

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the auto-generated short link">
    Li2.ai automatically creates a short link using the format `li2.ai/[random-string]`.

    For example: `https://li2.ai/hcdfs`

    This works perfectly for most campaigns, but you can customize it if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the back-half (optional)">
    To create a memorable, branded link, click the **edit icon** next to the short link field.

    ![Custom Back Half Pn](/images/custom-back-half.png)

    **Customization options**:

    - `li2.ai/summer-launch` (campaign-specific)
    - `li2.ai/demo-request` (action-focused)
    - `li2.ai/new-product` (product-focused)

    **Best practices**:

    - Keep it short and memorable
    - Use hyphens instead of spaces
    - Make it relevant to your campaign
    - Avoid special characters

    <Warning>
      You can only change the back-half up to 5 times, so choose thoughtfully! The system will track all versions for analytics.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand link versioning">
    When you edit a short link, Li2.ai creates a new version while keeping the old one accessible.

    This means:

    - Previous links continue to work
    - You can track performance across versions
    - Analytics show the complete history
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 4: Configure Multi-Channel Distribution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable LINK channel">
    The **LINK** channel is automatically enabled - this creates your primary short link for digital sharing.

    **Use cases**:

    - Social media posts
    - Email campaigns
    - Digital advertisements
    - Website buttons and CTAs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable QR code generation">
    Toggle **ON** the **QR** channel to generate a professional QR code.

    ![Configure Integration Channels Pn](/images/Configure-integration-channels.png)

    **Use cases**:

    - Print advertisements
    - Business cards
    - Product packaging
    - Event materials
    - Physical store displays

    <Info>
      Each channel can have different destination URLs for advanced A/B testing, but for your first touchpoint, they'll both use the same destination.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note upcoming channels">
    You'll see **WiFi** and **NFC** options marked as "Coming soon":

    - **WiFi**: For sharing WiFi network access with branded touchpoints
    - **NFC**: For tap-to-access experiences with NFC-enabled devices

    These will be available in future updates!
  </Step>
</Steps>
