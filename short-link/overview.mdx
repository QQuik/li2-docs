# Touchpoints Overview

Touchpoints are the heart of Li2.ai's marketing platform. Far more than simple shortened links, touchpoints are comprehensive marketing assets that enable sophisticated campaign distribution, tracking, and optimization across multiple channels.

## What Are Touchpoints?

A **touchpoint** is a professional marketing asset that connects your audience to your content through multiple distribution channels. Each touchpoint includes:

- **Smart Link Management** - Branded short URLs with versioning and change tracking
- **Multi-Channel Distribution** - Links, QR codes, and upcoming WiFi/NFC options
- **Independent Routing** - Different destinations per channel for advanced testing
- **Advanced Analytics** - Comprehensive tracking and performance measurement
- **Social Optimization** - Custom meta tags and images for perfect social sharing
- **Campaign Organization** - Tags, search, and filtering for professional management

<Note>
**Think of touchpoints as marketing campaigns, not just links.** Each touchpoint represents a complete strategy for reaching your audience across digital and physical channels.
